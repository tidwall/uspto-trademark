Ignore the question 2. 

Click "Continue".

## STEP 4

Fill out the application. 

What you enter here will become public record, so unless the mark is personally owned by you (an individual), make sure to use the company name and address.

At the bottom of the form, make sure to enter a website url that clearly uses the mark. This may help move the process along faster towards a [1A status](https://trademark.marcaria.com/hc/en-us/articles/211141606-1a-1b-44d-44e-Intent-to-Use-Actual-Use-Application-Types).

If needed, you can make **Additional Statements** about this mark, such as how it's translated in other languages, or how it's pronounced. Or just ignore this section if it consists of straightforward english words.

Click "Continue".

## STEP 6

Enter your Goods and Services. 

This is where you enter the type of goods and services that your mark represents.

Let's say you made some database software tools, you could select the international class "009" for software, and "Computer software for use in database management" for the description.

Or just search "Computer software for use in database management" in the search box

Click "Insert Checked Entries" to continue


## STEP 7

Enter your assignment status.

- **1A**: If you are currently using the mark for the goods and services defined above.
- **1B**: If you intend to use the mark in the near future.

For **1A** add a clear JPEG or PDF image of your mark.

**Describe your mark**

This can be a very simple description of the mark as a logo representation.

For example, MongoDB's logo is like:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5n8Hser.png" height="75">

and the description is:

```
The mark consists of the wording "MONGODB" next to a leaf design.
```

Enter the "date of first use anywhere" and "date of first use in commerce".
You want to be as accurate as possible because these dates are public record.

Click "Continue"

## STEP 8

Double check your application.

Click "Continue"

## STEP 9

Add a signatory. 

This is your name and signature in the form of `/john denton/`, including the slashes.

Click "continue".

## Step 10

Validate and pay!


## Step 11

Search for your mark on the [TEAS website](http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=searchss&state=4804:39dqte.2.1) often to check on your mark's registration status.
